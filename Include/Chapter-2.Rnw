\chapter{Data and Material}
\label{ch:DataMaterial}

	This thesis attempts to predicts the dynamics of Exchange Rate through Economic and Financial indicators. From these two broad categories, those factors are only consider which are believed to be useful to understand the exchange rate dynamics. As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:Introduction}, 

\section{ForeX Market}
\label{sec:forexMarket}
Foreign Exchange(Fx) Market is the most traded and liquid financial market where individuals, firms and banks buy and sell foreign currencies. Fx make constitute of monetary enters connected electronically which are in constant contact forming a single international financial market. The market remains open 24 hr a day for five working days of a week (\cite{fxIntro}). 

Currencies are exchanged for activities like trade, tourism and investments in another countries. For instance, a person in Norway wants to visit France, getting Euro is necessary as it is accepted in France. On returning back from the visit Euro should be exchanged to Norwegian Krone. This transaction is affected by the exchange rate of Norwegian Krone per Euro. The time-series plot for this exchange rate is in figure-\ref{fig:tsPerEURO}.

\section{The Norwegian krone (NOK)}
\label{sec:KroneInro}
After introduction of Krone in April 1975 (\cite{NorBnkHistory}), Norway was pushed to join the Scandinavian Monetary Union established on 1873 (\cite{nokHistoryOanda}). Although the Union was formally abolished on 1972, Norway decided to keep the names of its currencies. In December 1982, due to heavy speculation, Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway) decided to fix Norwegian Krone which was floated on 1992 (\cite{NorBnkHistory}).

\section{EURO}
\label{sec:EuroIntro}
Euro, the official currency in the Eurozone, was introduced as a virtual currency in 1999 and latter as physical in 2002. It is the single currency shared by 19 of the European Union's Member States of Euro Area. European Central Bank (ECB) manage Euro although fiscal policy (public revenue and expenditure) remains in the hands of individual national authorities. The single currency market throughout the euro zone not only makes traveling across the countries easier but also helps the member country to keep their economy sound and stable with low inflation. This situation removes currency exchange cost, smoothing international trade which, consequently gives them more powerful voice in the world. A stable economy and larger area protects euro zone from external economic fluctuation, instability in currency market and unpredictable rise in oil prices.(\cite{euro2015ecb})

\section{Factors influencing Exchange Rate}
\label{sec:AffectingFactors}
	The demand of any currency relative to its supply determines its price, like any other commodity. For each possible price of a Norwegian Krone, there is a corresponding demand and supply to be exchanged with euro for the currency in the money market. When the demand of krone equals its supply, the price it exhibit at some specific time is called its equilibrium exchange rate. Factors like inflation, interest rates, expectation created by trend of change, government policy affects the demand for any currency, i.e. the willingness to purchase that currency; however, the supply is mostly in control of central bank.  In a floating exchange rate regime, the shift in demand (fig-\ref{fig:demandShift}) and supply(fig-\ref{fig:supplyShift}) function  determines equilibrium exchange rate of any currency.

        \label{fig:supplyShift}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Effect of shifts on demand and supply of currencies on their Exchange rates}
\end{figure}

In the case of demand shift, at constant currency supply, the exchange rate will suddenly rise to $eâ€™_d$ creating deadweight loss (also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency\footnote{\url{http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Deadweight_loss.html}}) which consequently pushes the supply from $Q_0$ to $Q_1$ creating a new equilibrium exchange rate at $e_1$. In the similar fashion, if the market is over flooded with currency, shifting the supply function and creating deadweight loss, the exchange rate is pressed from $e_0$ to create a new equilibrium at $e_1$. Although the quantity supplied is increased in both of the situation, the first one leads to the increase in exchange rate while the other leads to its decrease.

\citet*[p.~103]{madura2012international} suggested an equation consisting those macroeconomic factors that can affect the demand and supply of any currency and consequently the exchange rate as,

\begin{equation}
\text{e} = f \left(\Delta \text{INF}, \Delta \text{INT}, \Delta \text{INC}, \Delta \text{GC}, \Delta \text{EXP}\right)
\end{equation}

where,
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{rl}
e: & percentage chage in spot exchange rate\\
$\Delta$ INF: & change in inflation differential between two countries (currencies)\\
$\Delta$ INT: & change in interest rate differential between two countries\\
$\Delta$ INC: & change in the income level differential between two countries\\
$\Delta$ GC: &  change in government control\\
$\Delta$ EXP: & change in currency value expectations\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Inflation}
\label{ssec:inflation}
Inflation is the steady rise in overall price level, i.e. a decrease in the value of currency. In other words, more amount of money is needed to buy same goods then previous. Relative change in inflation has effect on exchange rate. For instance, an abrupt jump in the inflation in Norway relative to the Eurozone, Norwegian products becomes relatively expensive in terms of Norwegian Currency. On one hand, this would increase the demands for Eurozone goods, and consequently the demand for euro in the short run. On the other hand, expensive Norwegian goods becomes less attractive in Eurozone and therefore reduce the supply of euro purchasing Norwegian kroner. In figure -\ref{fig:inflationEffect}, the demand function of Euro shift upward due to inflation of NOK, i.e. Eurozone goods are more attractive than Norwegian goods and the downward shift on supply  function occurs as the customers are less interested in Norwegian products. As a result the value of Euro per NOK increases from 9.10 to 9.97, i.e Norwegian Krone deprecates against the Euro (\cite[p.~104]{madura2012international}).

\end{figure}

Statistics Norway prepares and publishes the official figures for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) with base year at 1998. Since the real value of money is constantly decling, high inflation means that storing money is expensive. while low and stable inflation contributes to an efficient distribution of resources in a market economy (\cite{NorgesBank2007faq}). Data for CPI is obtained for this thesis from Norges bank, as this is an inportant factor that can influence exchange rate. The time-series plot for CPI is in figure-\ref{fig:tsCPI} shows an steady increment over the time. The influence of market interest rate flows through multiple channel such as demand channel, exchange Rate channel and expectation Channel as shown in figure-\ref{fig:mrktRateInfluence} (\cite{intRateEffect:2004NB}).

\subsection{Interest Rate}
\label{ssec:interestRate}
Since Interest rate impact inflation and currency values, by manipulating it, central banks exert influence over both inflation and exchange rates. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
    \includestandalone[width=0.6\linewidth]{include/interestRateShift}
    \flushright\scriptsize{Source: \cite{madura2012international}}
    \caption{Effect of Interest Rate change on Exchange Rate includes (a) Demand Shift: Due to increased interest rate in Norway, demand of Norwegian Krone increases creating a demand shift in demand function and (b) Supply Shift: The supply of Krone decrease as Norwegian increase their domestic investment creating a sortage of NOK in market.}
    \label{fig:intRateEffect}
\end{figure}

For example, a sudden increase in interest rate in Norway relative to Eurozone could have impact on investment of Eurozone in Norway with interest-bearing securities. The Eurozone investors wants to invest more in Norway which increases the demand for NOK in Eurozone. Due to stronger incentives, Norwegians also increase their domestic investment, as a result, the supply of NOK in currency market will reduce. The increase in Demand of NOK and decrease in its supply results a shift in exchange rate to lower level. The process is illustrated in figure - \ref{fig:intRateEffect}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includestandalone[width=\linewidth]{include/marketRate}

    \caption{Market Rate influence on demand channel, exchange rate channel and expectation channel}
    \label{fig:mrktRateInfluence}
\end{figure}

According to \citet{madura2012international}, change in interest rate in third country can affect the exchange rates between NOK and Euro. For instance, the sudden increase of interest rate in US would shift the european investment from Norway to US which consequently reduce the demand of NOK resulting a downward pressure on its exchange rate with Euro.

As the interest rate is a key factor influencing exchange rate, the key interest rate of Norway and Eurozone along with the loan interest rate of Norway is considered in this thesis. The time series plot of these variables are in figure - \ref{fig:intRates}. Due to simultenious act of other variables, the plot does not exhibit any discrete relationship. However, the model fitted by the data collected suggest some indepth understanding of this relationship which is analysed and presented in chapter-\ref{ch:dataAnalysis}.

\subsection{Income Levels}
\label{ssec:incLevels}

The rise in real income level leads to increase in the consumption level. Relative income levels of a country is another factor which can affect the demand of imported goods which consequently affect exchange rate (\cite{madura2012international}). For instance, if the income levels of people of eurozone rises, other factor being constant, the demand for foreign goods in eurozone may increase which can shift the demand function outward and subsequently increase the exchange rate (figure-\ref{fig:incEffect}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
    \includestandalone[width=0.6\linewidth]{include/incEffect}
    \flushright\scriptsize{Source: \cite{madura2012international}}
    \caption{Effect of change in relative income levels on exchange rate \textit{ceteris paribus}.}
    \label{fig:incEffect}
\end{figure}

The example considered above is on the assumption of \textit{ceteris paribus}, which in reality is not usual. The change in exchange rate due to income levels is also guided through the effect of income levels on interest rates and inflation. The increased income levels increase the consumption cause the economy to overheat. Central banks could increase interest rates to prevent overheating and increased inflation. Thus the relative change in income levels can affect exchange rates directly and indirectly (\cite[p.~106]{madura2012international}).

\subsection{Government Control}
\label{ssec:govControl}

Government Control is the fourth factor \citet{madura2012international} has considered that can influence foreign exchange rate. Government can influence exchange rate in many ways including, 
\begin{inlinelist}
    \item imposing foreign exchange barriers, 
    \item imposing foreign trade barriers, 
    \item intervening (buying and selling currencies) in the foreign exchange markets, and 
    \item affecting macro variables such as inflation, interest rates, and income levels.
\end{inlinelist}
Norges Bank could force the currency to depreciate by flooding the market with NOK (i.e increasing supply) if Norwey wants to boost its exports. Similarly, the bank could used their foreign currency reserve to purchase NOK to rise its value. Such direct interventions make considerable impact on the exchange rate. Further, the government can intervent indirectly influening the underlying macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rate and income level (\cite[p.~107]{madura2012international}). 

\subsection{Expectations}
\label{ssec:expectations}

Response to new information in foreign exchange market is similar to other financial market. The current expectation for the future value is reflected in the exchange rate changes. Like in stock market, when a company publishes its prosperous financial statement, the stock price suddenly rises; the forex market also exhibit similar performance. For example, a news of increasing inflation in Norway cause currency traders to sell Norwegian Krone expecting a decrease in its future value. This expectation is immediately seen as a downward pressure on Norwegian Krone. The similar effect is obtained when speculator expects the currency to depreciate (\cite[p.~107]{madura2012international}).

A person of one country need the currency of another country for various purpose such as trade of goods and services, foreign investment and travelling. The actual flow of currency from one country to another is in these forms of activities. The volume of transaction of trade in terms of goods and services between specific countries is kept recorded as a form of balance of payment which can even have signal of possible shifts in exchange rate.

\section{Balance of Payment}
\label{sec:bop} 
Although international trade is possessed in various forms, the transaction of multiple currency is common in each of them. A country keep these transaction with other countries as a form of Balance of Payments. A balance of payment account maintain a systematic records of these transaction conducted at some specific time period between a home country and others (those countries with which the transactions are made). A balance of payment account of a country exhibit the size of its economic activities with rest of the world (\cite[p.~462]{appleyard2014international}).

As Balance of Payment is a bookkeeping system for inter countries economic activities, the items with payments inward to the home country are credited while payments outward from the home country are debited. Exports, inflow of foreign investment, interest and devidents obtained from the investment made on foreign country by the home country are considered as credited items as they increase the inward flow of currency. Similary, Imports, investment made on foreign countries, interest and devidents paied to foreign countries for their investment in home country are the items to be debited (\cite[p.~465]{appleyard2014international}).

\end{table}

Balance of payment can be classified into two broad categories - \begin{inlinelist}\item Current Account and \item Capital Account \end{inlinelist}. The items that lies in these subcategories are illustrated in table-\ref{tab:bopComponents}.
