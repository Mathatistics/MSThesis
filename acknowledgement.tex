I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Ellen Sandberg and Trygve Alm\o y for their guidance and invaluable suggestions. I am grateful to Prof. Solve S\ae b{\o } for his helpful advice and instructions. I want to thank Statistic Norway and Norges Bank for making valuable data easily available without which it is impossible to complete my thesis.

Being a student of a developing country, I was unaware of programming, modern statistical methods and academic writing. With the encouragement of Prof. Solve S\ae b{\o } and my supervisors, I have completed by thesis with extensive use of R programming and modern statistical tools.

Finally, my special thanks also goes to my families and friends for their continuous support and encouragement.
